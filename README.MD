# ANSi to EBCDiC

(source: https://16colo.rs/pack/twst0297/THMAN-05.ASC)

This python script does a little bit more than converting ANSi art to EBCDiC but the name is catchy.

This script will take any ANSi art you can find/create and convert it in to the HLASM/JCL you need to display the art in TN3270. Some great ANSi/ASCii art can be found at https://16colo.rs

## Installation

ANSi2EBCDIC requires Python3 and the library [SAUCE](https://github.com/tehmaze/sauce).
Due to the SAUCE library not having a Python3 Pypi release right now, the installation
is a bit messy.

You can install and run ANSi2EBCDIC like this:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mainframed/ANSi2EBCDiC.git
$ cd ANSi2EBCDiC
$ python3 -m venv app
$ git clone https://github.com/tehmaze/sauce.git
$ (cd sauce && ../app/bin/python3 setup.py install)
$ app/bin/python3 ansi2ebcdic.py --help
```

## Usage

The output produced by this script will assemble and link your program and place it where it needs to go so you can use it in VTAM usstables (z/OS and TK4-) or just run it from TSO.

This script gives you multiple options and works on z/OS as well as Jay Moseley's Sysgen and TK4- (running on hercules). These options can be broken down as the following:

### --usstable

If you're running your own zPDT z/OS mainframe, or you just want to spruce up your corporate mainframe this option will take whatever ANSi art you pass it and convert it to the HLASM/JCL needed to make a valid USS Table for VTAM.

When generating a USS Table you need a place to allow user input. By default this script places the cursor, in red, at row 23, column 20 with a field size of 20. You can change these by supplying a row, column and color by specifying the following:

* `--color` the color for the cursor, default is red
* `--ROW` the row for the cursor, default is 23
* `--COL` the column for the cursor, default is 20
* `--input` how wide the input area is, default is 20

For USS tables you need to supply a member name with `--member`, this should be the member name in your TN3270 parmlib `BEGINVTAM` (config file) in your TCPIP configuration.

```
BEGINVTAM
  ...
  USSTCP MEMBER

ENDVTAM
```
replace MEMBER with your member name, the default is ANSIART.

You also need to supply a dataset with `--dataset`, this is where the assembled HLASM will be stored. It needs to be in your VTAM library. On zPDT/ADCD you can typically store it in USER.VTAMLIB. This setting is set in your VTAM start procedure under `//VTAMLIB` and the search order is top to bottom.

Once uploaded with either FTP or IND$FILE, you need to submit the job with `submit` in ISPF, then you need to refresh and reload the USS Table. To do this use the MVS command: `vary tcpip,tn3270,obeyfile,dsn=user.tcpparms(tn3270)`, replace `USER.TCPPARM(TN3270)` with the location of your actual TN3270 settings. To do this on ADCD, in ISPF enter the command `=sd` and hit enter. Then type `/` hit enter, then enter the command `vary tcpip,tn3270,obeyfile,dsn=user.tcpparms(tn3270)`.

## --sysgen

This is for use on Jay Moseley's SYSGEN or the [automated sysgen](https://github.com/MVS-sysgen/sysgen). This replaces the standard MVS VTAM screen with the ansi art supplied. This script will automatically generate the JCL you need to create your own VTAM netsol screen.

Unlike usstable, you don't need to supply a dataset name as the dataset use to store the compiled uss table is stored in `SYS1.VTAMLIB(ISTNSC00)`. The source HLASM generated is stored in the member name supplied by `--member` in `SYS1.UMODMAC`.

When generating you need a place to allow user input. By default this script places the cursor, in red, at row 23, column 20 with a field size of 20. You can change these by supplying a row, column and color by specifying the following:

* `--color` the color for the cursor, default is red
* `--ROW` the row for the cursor, default is 23
* `--COL` the column for the cursor, default is 20
* `--input` how wide the input area is, default is 20

Once you've uploaded (using FTP or IND$FILE) the JCL, submit it in TK4- with `submit` and run the following commands to refresh VTAM:

```
 Shut down the services:
     /Z NET,QUICK
     /P SNASOL
     /P JRP
 Then bring the services back:
     /S NET
     /S SNASOL
     /S JRP
```
## --netsol

This is for use on TK4- (or potentially any MVS 3.8j implementation but has only been tested on TK4-). This replaces the standard MVS TK4- VTAM screen with the ansi art supplied. This script will automatically generate the JCL you need to create your own VTAM netsol screen. It keeps the terminal ID/dat and time in the upper left/right of the terminal.

Unlike usstable, you don't need to supply a dataset name as the dataset use to store the compiled uss table is stored in `SYS1.VTAMLIB(ISTNSC00)`. The source HLASM generated is stored in the member name supplied by `--member` in `SYS1.UMODMAC`.

When generating a USS Table you need a place to allow user input. By default this script places the cursor, in red, at row 23, column 20 with a field size of 20. You can change these by supplying a row, column and color by specifying the following:

* `--color` the color for the cursor, default is red
* `--ROW` the row for the cursor, default is 23
* `--COL` the column for the cursor, default is 20
* `--input` how wide the input area is, default is 20

Once you've uploaded (using FTP or IND$FILE) the JCL, submit it in TK4- with `submit` and run the following commands to refresh VTAM:

```
 Shut down the services:
     /Z NET,QUICK
     /P SNASOL
     /P JRP
 Then bring the services back:
     /S NET
     /S SNASOL
     /S JRP
```

### --tso

If you don't want to change your VTAM terminals but instead just want to show off some amazing ANSI art (for example in a TSO exit, or for use with logon procs, or you just want to call it yourself) you can use the `--tso` argument.

This argument generates the HLASM/JCL you need to be able to call an assembled program from TSO and display the art to your 3270 terminal.

Since the JCL for TK4- and z/OS are different you need to supply either `--tk4` or `--zos` when using this argument.

By default the script stores the assembled output in `ANSI.ART(ANSIART)`. To change this use the `--dataset` and `--member` arguments. The dataset needs to be a previously created PDS/PDSE before you place your art in it.

Once the script is done you can upload your HLASM/JCL with FTP or IND$FILE and submit the JCL. To view the art, in TSO use the command `CALL ANSI.ART(ANSIART)` using the `--dataset` and `--member` if you changed those.


### Optional arguments

#### Output File:

By default this script will display the HLASM to the terminal. If you want to save it to a file use the `--file` argument.

#### Extended colors

By default most TN3270 emulators only support the colors: white, red, green, yellow, blue, pink, and turquoise. On some emulators, for example `x3270` you can get extra the extra colors: black, deep blue, orange, purple, pale green, pale turquoise, and grey.

If you know your terminal supports the extra colors use the argument `--extended` to enable them. If the ANSi you are your using uses the default/dim colors you'll want to enable this feature.

Example, here's the original art: https://16colo.rs/pack/5th-9704/LK-IRID1.ANS

**Extended Graphics**

### Debug

If you want to see what the script is doing behind the scenes there is a `--debug` argument. Be warned, however, that this debug output is very verbose.

Example output (with debuging enabled):

```
./ansi2ebcdic.py --dataset ANSI.ART --member IRIDIUM --tso --tk4 --file iridium2.jcl --jobname iridium --extended --debug ./LK-IRID1.ANS

## Known Bugs

You will run out of addressability if the ANSi art is too complicated. This could be fixed in a future version.
